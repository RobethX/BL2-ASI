# UnrealEngine PythonSDK
An UnrealEngine Plugin enabling using Python to write plugins that interact directly with UE objects

## List of compatible games
* Borderlands 2 (1.8.7)
* Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!

## Installation

1. [Download the latest version of `PythonSDK.zip`.](https://github.com/Matt-Hurd/BL2-SDK/releases) Ensure you download `PythonSDK.zip` from that page:

2. Open `PythonSDK.zip`. It should contain 4 items:

3. Locate your game's files. In Steam, this can be done by right-clicking on the game in your library, selecting "Properties," then in the "Local Files" section, clicking "Browse":

4. In the game's files, navigate to the `Binaries`, then the `Win32` folder. This folder should contain the `.exe` for your game (i.e. `Borderlands2.exe` or `BorderlandsPreSequel.exe`).

5. Copy the 4 items from `PythonSDK.zip` **exactly as they** are to the `Win32` folder. Note that `pythonXX.zip` should *not* be un-zipped:

6. If you had previously installed an older version of the SDK, delete any old files that weren't overwritten by the ones in the latest `PythonSDK.zip`.

7. You are done, and may launch the game (if it is running, relaunch it now). You should see a "Mods" menu in the main menu!

8. If the SDK fails to run with the files correctly in place as described above, you may need to [download and install Mircosoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).

### Linux (SteamPlay/Proton and Wine)

PythonSDK does not yet work natively on Linux, but it seems to work well under SteamPlay/Proton and Wine.  To load properly, though, Wine needs to be told to allow `ddraw.dll` overrides.  Additionally, the latest SDK release (as of February 29, 2020) wants the main executable name to be `Borderlands2.exe`, so the common workaround of a `Launcher.exe` symlink/copy won't do the trick.  Instead, set the game's launch options (via `Properties -> General`) to:

    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw=n,b" bash -c 'exec "${@/Launcher.exe/Borderlands2.exe}"' -- %command%

Or, for TPS:

    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw=n,b" bash -c 'exec "${@/Launcher.exe/BorderlandsPreSequel.exe}"' -- %command%

Note that using `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` for `ddraw` isn't supported by the Wine developers, so if you experience problems with the game while using this method, please don't ask the WineHQ team for assistance.

## Usage

`py <python code>` runs arbitrary python code.  
`pyexec <python file>` runs arbitrary python files from `binaries/Win32/Mods/`.


### Installing Mods

Mods live in the `Borderlands 2\Binaries\Win32\Mods` folder. Each mod should be place in it's own subfolder, and contain an `__init__.py`. Example: `Win32\Mods\SkillRandomizer\__init__.py`   


## Borderlands Ingame Mod Manager

On the main menu, `Downloadable Content` is replace with `Mods`
